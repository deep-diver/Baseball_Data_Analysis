# Baseball Data Analysis in Tableau

## Introduction

This repository shows exploratory data visualization on baseball players' data. Among many choice of visualization tools, I have chosen Tableau because of its simpleness to write and share. For further information, here is the [link for the Tableau project](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chansung#!/vizhome/baseballplayeranalysis/1_1?publish=yes).
